Badlogistics started as a side project after I had been on the Flow
Festival '08 in Helsinki. The hall inspired me to make something similar
into a map. At first, the map was just a big box and started to shape up
from there.Of course just a hall would have been a bit boring so I added
an abundant amount of boxes! The map has two sides separated by a pair
of rail tracks and some train cars. It also features a second level of
catwalks and passages.
